This app adds is made to be used in a distibuted enviroment that uses UF's to proxy data from other UF's towards an indexer:

+----+            +-----+
| UF |   +----+   |     |
| UF +->-+ UF +->-+ IDX |
| UF |   +----+   |     |   +----+
+---+             | IDX |   | SH |
                  |     +-<-+ SH |
+----+            | IDX |   | SH |
| UF |   +----+   |     |   +----+
| UF +->-+ UF +->-+ IDX |
| UF |   +----+   |     |
+---+             +-----+

This app will add a additional field "splunk_forwarder" to the data that is beeing send from the "intermediate" forwarder towards the indexers.
It needs to be "split" into 3 parts.
1) Intermediate forwarders: 
	bin/set_forwarder_name.py
	default/inputs.conf

2) Indexers:
	default/props.conf
	default/transforms.conf

3) Searchheads:
	default/fields.conf
